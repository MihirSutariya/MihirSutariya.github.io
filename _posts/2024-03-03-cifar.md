This is a starting of Deep learning and machine learning. Mainly talking basic model of CNN and results. Happy Reading üòÅ

# How create an architecture

CIFAR-10 is a dataset with 50K images of 10 classes for training and 10K for tests. There are state of the art models available but i wanted to go with my own.

Started with basic model, 2 CNN layers and 3 fully connected layers. Here is link to my experiment [.ipynb]() file

**Why this architecture and not different?**
I always have this question when i see others solutions. But i think i got an answer by doing this exercise. 

1. First you go with whatever knowledge of any model components you have.
2. Try to add more and more complexity. Find why accuracy is not getting better and add a little something which your intuition says.
3. Try to tune hyperparameters for the current architecture to get best out of the model.
